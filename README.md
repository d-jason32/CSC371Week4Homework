## GPA Calculator
    At least five labels (textviews) and text fields that accept grades for 5 courses.

    A button with the label “Compute GPA”

    A Label to display the GPA.

    The app should be called ‘GPA_[your net id]_Calculator’

    Select and assign an icon for the app.

    Your app should not accept empty fields

    Your app should display a red background if GPA is less than 60, Yellow for 61-79, and Green for 80 to 100.

    The text on the compute button should be changed to clear form once clicked.

Additional challenges:

    When you start typing in the fields again after the first GPA calculation, change back the button text to show computed GPA.

    If an entry field doesn’t have the right data make it red.
