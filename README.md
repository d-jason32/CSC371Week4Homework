## GPA Calculator
1. App has 5 labels and text fields that only accept doubles as grades.
2. There is a button to compute your GPA.
3. There is a text label to display the GPA. 
4. The app icon is a graduation cap.
5. You cannot accept any empty fields. 
6. The background turns red if the gpa is less than 60, yellow for 60-80, and green if greater than 80.
7. Added a scrolling view so the app works in landscape and portrait. 


    The text on the compute button should be changed to clear form once clicked.

    When you start typing in the fields again after the first GPA calculation, change back the button text to show computed GPA.

    If an entry field doesnâ€™t have the right data make it red.
